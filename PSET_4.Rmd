# Problem 15

You take numsim samples of size n from a gamma distribution with parameters $\hat{\alpha}$ and $\hat{\lambda}$ and find the upper quartile of each sample. You use the standard deviation of these numsim samples as the estimation of the standard error of $q_hat$.

# Problem 17

## Part (a)

Plot various density curves for different values of alpha.

## Part (b)

Sample from the distribution (with some given alpha), find $\mu_2$, and plug into derived formula to get $\hat{\alpha}$

## Part (c)

## Part (d)

Asymptotic variance formula given on page 277.

## Part (e)

Sufficient statistic formula given on page 306.
